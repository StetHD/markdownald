This is another node-webkit application for markdown editing.
It's really targeted for github flavored markdown and try to be a real desktop app, not a web app ported to node-webkit.

# Installation
First you will need to install node-webkit for your platform see [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) repository for details

then clone this repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:malko/markdownald.git
```

go to the application directory and launch node-webkit:
```
$ cd markdownald
$ nm ./
```
or under linux if nw is in your path you can launch directly 
```
$ ./markdownald/markdownald.sh
```

## Todo

- [ ] add recent list file management to the file menu
- [x] add mode wrap to user settings
- [x] better css for markdown rendering
